## Blog Sample made with Django

This is my first testing api made with Django. I mainly followed a tutorial by Mr. Corey Schafer.

I added some more functionality like posting comments (with the option to approve or delete them), listing posts by categories, tags or date posted or inserting images to posts.

I tried many ways on the way and the traces of them might still remain that should be cleaned up later. Some functionalities need some more JavaScript(with React, maybe) to make them working in more decent manners, especially image uploads to posts, that I should work on soon.
